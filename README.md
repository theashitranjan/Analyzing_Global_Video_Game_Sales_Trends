# Analyzing_Global_Video_Game_Sales_Trends
This project analyzes a historical video game sales dataset to uncover key drivers of commercial success. By exploring trends in top-selling genres, platforms, and publishers, the analysis aims to visualize the industry's evolution and identify patterns that have defined the market over the years.

An Analysis of Global Video Game Sales TrendsProject by Prince Kumar | September 2025üìñ Project OverviewThis project provides an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the "Video Game Sales with Ratings" dataset. The primary goal is to uncover historical trends and identify the key factors that have driven commercial success in the video game industry from 1980 to 2020. By visualizing data on top-selling genres, platforms, and publishers, this analysis tells the story of the industry's evolution and transformation over four decades.üöÄ Key Findings & VisualizationsThe analysis uncovered several key insights into the dynamics of the video game market:1. Genre Dominance: Action & Sports Lead the PackThe market has historically favored fast-paced, high-engagement titles. Action games are the undisputed leaders in revenue, followed closely by Sports and Shooter genres.2. The Reign of the Consoles: PlayStation 2 SupremeIn terms of software sales, the PlayStation 2 stands as the most successful platform of all time, highlighting the commercial power of the 6th and 7th console generations (which also include the Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii).3. The Industry's Golden Age: A Peak in 2008The market for physical game sales saw exponential growth throughout the 2000s, reaching its absolute peak in 2008. The subsequent decline does not signify a market crash, but rather a fundamental shift towards digital distribution and the rise of mobile gaming, which are not fully captured in this dataset.4. The Publishing Giants: Nintendo's Unmatched SuccessNintendo leads all other publishers by a significant margin in total revenue. This is a testament to the power of their first-party franchises (like Mario, Zelda, and Pok√©mon) and their unique business model of developing both the hardware and the software.üìä The DatasetSource: Video Game Sales with Ratings on KaggleContent: Contains over 16,500 records of video games that have sold over 100,000 copies.Limitation: The sales data primarily reflects physical retail sales. It does not account for the modern digital games market (Steam, App Store, etc.) or in-game purchases.üíª Technology StackThis project was created using the standard Python data science stack:Python 3: Core programming language.Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and aggregation.Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating static and attractive data visualizations.Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and reporting.‚öôÔ∏è How to Run This ProjectTo explore the analysis yourself, please follow these steps:Clone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[Your-GitHub-Username]/video-game-sales-analysis.git
